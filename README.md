# Google Dialer and Contacts apps for the OnePlus 5T
This is a Google Dialer module for the OnePlus 5T running OOS with full capabilities such as Caller ID and Nearby Places. The Google Contacts app is included as well.
Both apps are updatable through the Play Store.
OnePlus 5 should work as well but not tested.

Sorry for another update, it should be fine for now :)
